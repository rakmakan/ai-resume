## Context & Background
I'm applying for a position at **{{company_name}}** for the role: **{{job_title}}**

Resume Structure:
- Resume is built in LaTeX with modular sections located at: {{section_path}}
- Main resume file that compiles all sections: {{resume_tex_path}}
- **IMPORTANT**: Only update the text content, never modify LaTeX formatting, commands, or structure

## Job Details
**Company:** {{company_name}}
**Position:** {{job_title}}

**Job Description:**
{{job_description}}

## Your Task: Tailor the Resume Sections

### 1. Experience Section ({{experience_tex_path}})
**Current State:** Contains comprehensive experience across multiple domains and technologies
**Your Goal:**
- Prioritize and highlight experiences most relevant to this specific role
- Reorder bullet points to lead with most relevant achievements
- Emphasize quantifiable results that align with job requirements
- Use keywords from the job description naturally
- Remove or minimize less relevant experiences (but don't delete entirely)
- Focus on achievements that demonstrate the required skills and impact

**Guidelines:**
- Match the seniority level mentioned in job description
- Highlight leadership/collaboration if mentioned in requirements
- Emphasize technical skills, tools, and frameworks mentioned in the job posting
- Quantify achievements with metrics when possible (%, $, time saved, etc.)

### 2. Skills Section ({{skill_tex_path}})
**Your Goal:**
- Reorder skills to prioritize those mentioned in job description
- Group related skills that align with job requirements
- Ensure primary technologies/tools from job posting are prominently featured
- Remove outdated or irrelevant skills for this specific role

### 3. Projects Section ({{projects_tex_path}})
**Your Goal:**
- Highlight projects that demonstrate skills required for this role
- Rewrite project descriptions to emphasize relevant technologies and outcomes
- Show progression and growth that aligns with the target position
- Include metrics and impact where possible

### 4. Additional Considerations
- **Keywords**: Naturally incorporate important keywords from job description
- **ATS Optimization**: Ensure exact matches for critical technical terms
- **Company Research**: If you know about {{company_name}}'s technology stack, industry, or values, subtly align the resume accordingly
- **Role Level**: Ensure the resume reflects the appropriate seniority level for this position
- **Cultural Fit**: Highlight experiences that show alignment with company values (if mentioned)

## Important Rules
1. **Never add fictional information** - only reorganize, emphasize, and reword existing content
2. **Maintain truthfulness** - all achievements and experiences must be genuine
3. **Preserve LaTeX structure** - only modify text content within existing formatting
4. **Keep it concise** - prioritize quality over quantity, remove less relevant details
5. **Focus on impact** - emphasize results and achievements over just responsibilities

## Output Format
Provide the updated content for each section, clearly labeled, ready to replace the existing content in the respective .tex files.
